# TCS-iON-RIO-45
Automate detection of different emotions from textual comments and feedback 

# Project Description:
# Project Objective & Brief:  
To develop a deep learning algorithm to detect different types of emotion contained in a collection of English Sentences or a larger paragraph

# Project Guidelines
1. Identify and finalize a collection of English text,sentences or large paragraphs covering emotions like happy,sad,expressing,love,anger or surprise.
2. Develop a deep learning model for detection & segmentation of emotions contained in the text,sentence or paragraph
3. The above model should also accurately handle scenarios where the following are present
    a. Sarcastic Meaning
    b. Double negation words
    c. Abbreviations like 'nxt','2tmrw','things r gd',etc).
4. Test the model for accuracy.

# Expected Project Outcome

1. Algorithm to detect different types of emotion from a paragraph.
2. Detailed presentation with proof of reasonable accuracy
