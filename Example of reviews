 Season 4 - Stuck in a Rut Script
westsideschl1 January 2021
1. Overacted like reciting highly scripted very fake dialogue, 
and all in sequence as if after every short line the director pauses to allow the actors to memorize the next line.
And, of course, practice a devilish smile. 
2. Over reliance on romance issues with the usual eye candy actors. 
Lucifer, of course, has short beard growth (very manly fake) as if the devil really needs that along with muscles (shown frequently).
Why for someone with God like super powers. To showcase the body we have a very fake (and overused) holding up a car as it's wheels spin in trying to get away.
3. The usual 10 seconds of staged dead body scene (very cheaply popular in crime series); the usual interdepartmental detective conflicts & issues. 4. Special effects consist mostly of two cheap (thankfully always brief) film items: Colored eyes (seen in all superpower movies), 
  and wings that are so cheap they would fall apart if moved. 5. Hell looked like a studio CGI quickie: A background of trees; above are clouds; 
  the throne is a jagged rock nestled amongst other fake jagged rocks. Huh! Not the Hell I know. 
Anyway, gotta have a King to sit there to stop (contain) the demons of Hell from coming to Earth. 
Please, send the demons, they would be a lot more interesting than this script.

Lucifer should have stayed dead.
John6Daniels20 March 2021
Its just a show the glorifies being a bad person.

Lucifer is hash TV. It go can'd because it was hash then they resurrect her and its still hash.

Overall good quality alone can't save this show.

What can be learned? To glorify negativity.

Verdict: I ain't no Christian but this show is Hell bound...Again...
